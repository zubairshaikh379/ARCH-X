## Read the monetization skill first

Before using anything in this skill, read the `monetization` skill and follow its routing instructions. It is the single source of truth for choosing a payment provider on Replit. Only continue with this RevenueCat skill once the monetization skill has confirmed that RevenueCat is the right provider (either because the user explicitly named RevenueCat, the project already has RevenueCat wired up, or the routing question resolved to RevenueCat).

## Introduction

- RevenueCat lets users monetize their native mobile apps on Replit.
- The RevenueCat integration is only intended to be used for the Expo/mobile stack on Replit.
- If the stack used is *not* Expo/mobile, do not use RevenueCat, and instead suggest the Stripe integration.
- The package used in the React Native client code is `react-native-purchases`. Always download the version that is compatible with the version of React Native/Expo used in the app.

## Prerequisites

1. These packages must be installed in the workspace root package.json:
    - `react-native-purchases` - Official client-side SDK for React Native. This should be used on the client.
    - `@replit/revenuecat-sdk` - SDK for RevenueCat's REST API. This should NEVER be used on the client, only for server-side scripts.

    If they are not installed, use npm to install them: `$ cd /home/runner/workspace && npm install <packages>`


2. The RevenueCat integration must be connected to the repl. This is necessary as the integration creates an authenticated client for RevenueCat accessible via a function `getUncachableRevenueCatClient`. You can do this by proposing the integration. Reference the `integrations` skill if necessary.

You are required to ensure these requirements are met before setting up or using RevenueCat.

## Project Structure

- **Scripts directory**: `scripts/` at the workspace root (e.g., `scripts/seedRevenueCat.ts`)
- **Run a script**: `npx tsx scripts/<script>.ts`
- **Client app directory**: `client/`

Reference files use these terms. Map them to these concrete paths.

## Essential Clarifications -- Critical

- RevenueCat DOES work in Expo Go and DOES NOT require a native build. In Expo Go, the SDK automatically runs in Preview API Mode, replacing native calls with JavaScript mocks so your app loads without errors.
- RevenueCat DOES work on the web out of the box without any additional configuration.
- RevenueCat's Test Store DOES work out of the box and DOES NOT require additional code checks.

## RevenueCat Architecture

- **Projects:** A RevenueCat project is the top-level entity for RevenueCat - it's like a container for your apps, products, entitlements, and integrations.
  - Each project comes with a Test Store where you can create products, configure offerings, and test the complete purchase flow—without connecting to any app store or payment provider.
- **Apps:** An app in RevenueCat is a platform-specific configuration that connects your project to a store (e.g., an iOS app connected to Apple App Store, an Android app connected to Google Play Store, or a web app connected to Stripe/Paddle).
- **Products:** The individual items users purchase (e.g., "Monthly Premium")
- **Entitlements:** The access level users receive (e.g., "premium"). Most apps use a single entitlement (e.g., "pro"). They are linked to products: when a product is purchased, its associated entitlements become active.
  - The flow: User purchases a Product -> which then unlocks an Entitlement -> You check the entitlement to grant access.
- **Offerings:** The set of products available to a user. Allow you to change available products without app updates. Access via `offerings.current` on the client for the default offering.
  - The client side code always queries the current offering as a source of truth to get the products and packages available to the user. Therefore, it is critical that this be always up to date.
- **Packages:** Containers for products within an offering.
- **CustomerInfo**: The central object containing all subscription and purchase data for a user

## Storing Data

Do NOT Create Product Tables or Maintain Any Other Source of Truth for In-App Purchases

**Bad** — creates duplicate product storage:

```ts
export const products = pgTable("products", {
  id: varchar("id").primaryKey(),
  name: text("name"),
  price: integer("price"),
  // ... custom fields
});
```

Correct Approach:

- NO product tables needed!
- Query directly from RevenueCat SDK

Key Principle
"If it exists in RevenueCat, it belongs in RevenueCat"

- Don't duplicate RevenueCat data in your own tables.
- Don't create parallel storage systems.
- RevenueCat + metadata = your complete product catalog.
- Your tables should only store data that RevenueCat doesn't manage.

## Free Trials

- Free trials are not supported in the test store due to a RevenueCat limitation.
- Free trials can be configured directly in App Store Connect and the Google Play Console.
- If a user asks about adding free trials:
  - Inform them of this limitation and note that the client can automatically detect and display free trials via RevenueCat once enabled in production.
  - RevenueCat reads store product metadata, including trial details, in the package object.

## Working with Prices

- Never hardcode prices in the client code; always derive them from the subscription context.
- Prices in the test store are immutable; production store prices are configured in App Store Connect and the Google Play Console.
- If a user does not have a specific price in mind, suggest a price based on the app's vertical by pulling data from two sources:
  1. RevenueCat's State of Subscription Apps 2026 Report: For category-specific benchmark data (e.g., "Health apps typically charge $7.99-$9.99/month"). Report available here: https://www.revenuecat.com/pdf/state-of-subscription-apps-2026-sosa.pdf

  2. App Store Competitive Search: For real-time market context (e.g., "I found 5 similar habit trackers with a median price of $5.99/month").

  This way, a data-backed recommendation can be presented for the user to confirm or adjust.

## Publishing to the App Store

As the user approaches App Store Connect configuration, ensure the user is aware of the following:

1. **Privacy Policy**: Apple requires a Privacy Policy URL for App Store submission.
    - Ensure the user is aware of this and offer to draft a hosted Privacy Policy page. A tailored policy can then be generated (covering data collection, RevenueCat, Apple, and contact info) and hosted as a simple web page within the Replit project.

2. **Apple Small Business Program**: Nearly all developers building on Replit qualify for Apple's Small Business Program, reducing commission from 30% to 15%. However, enrollment is manual.
    - Once a user confirms they have an Apple Developer Account (i.e. they published their app to TestFlight), prompt the user: "Before you launch, make sure you're enrolled in Apple's Small Business Program. This reduces Apple's commission from 30% to 15% on all sales - you almost certainly qualify. Enroll here: https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/enroll/"

3. **Syncing RevenueCat to App Store Connect**: In-app purchases won't be automatically configured in Apple
    - This is only crucial if/once a user has successfully published their app to TestFlight and/or confirms they have an Apple Developer account
    - Replit offers a native method to sync products from RevenueCat to Apple after they publish their app to TestFlight, which can be found in the Publishing pane

RevenueCat and Apple App Store Connect require additional configuration for in-app purchases to work.

## Troubleshooting

- **"RevenueCat project ID is required"**: Read the environment variables skill and ensure "REVENUECAT_PROJECT_ID" is set to the RevenueCat project id. If not, set it.

- **[RevenueCat] Native module (RNPurchases) not found.**: Ensure react-native-purchases is installed specifically in the Expo app workspace package; it must not be installed in the workspace root.

- **Error: failed to create product in App Store Connect. This product ID has already been used.**: Store identifiers in App Store Connect, cannot be reused, even if deleted. Offer the user to recreate the iOS products in RevenueCat to use different store identifiers
