# Image Search

Search the public web for real images.

## When to Use

- You need real logos, transparent PNGs, or brand assets from the web
- You need real-world photos or reference images from the public web

## When NOT to Use

- Generating new images or illustrations (use the `media-generation` skill)
- General fact lookup or webpage text retrieval (use the `web-search` skill)
- Extracting brand colors, fonts, and other official tokens from a website (use `extractBranding` first)

## Available Function

### `imageSearch({ query, count })`

Search for public web images and return the raw provider response body.

**Parameters:**

- `query` (str, required): Search text for the desired images
- `count` (int, optional): Maximum number of results to return

**Returns:** Dict with optional `results` list. For each result, rely on `result.title` and `result.imageUrl`; other provider-specific fields may also be present.

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "type": "images",
  "query": {
    "original": "mid-century chair",
    "spellcheck_off": false,
    "show_strict_warning": false
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "type": "image_result",
      "title": "Mid-century chair in walnut",
      "imageUrl": "https://imgs.example.com/full.jpg",
      "url": "https://example.com/chairs",
      "source": "example.com",
      "page_fetched": "2026-04-17T23:51:41Z",
      "thumbnail": {
        "src": "https://imgs.example.com/thumb.jpg",
        "width": 500,
        "height": 333
      },
      "properties": {
        "url": "https://imgs.example.com/full.jpg",
        "placeholder": "https://imgs.example.com/placeholder.jpg",
        "width": 1200,
        "height": 800
      },
      "meta_url": {
        "scheme": "https",
        "netloc": "example.com",
        "hostname": "example.com",
        "favicon": "https://example.com/favicon.ico",
        "path": "› chairs"
      },
      "confidence": "high"
    }
  ],
  "extra": {
    "might_be_offensive": false
  }
}
```

**Example:**

```javascript
const response = await imageSearch({
  query: "vintage travel posters",
  count: 6,
})

const items = response.results ?? []
for (const item of items.slice(0, 4)) {
  console.log(item.title, item.imageUrl)
}
```

## Present Results

When showing image results to the user:

1. Pick up to 4 strong results
2. Download each image URL into `attached_assets/image_search/`
3. Call `presentAsset({ filePath, title })` for each saved file

```javascript
// 1) DURABLE: callbacks live here, never inside "use impure"
const response = await imageSearch({ query: "mid-century chair", count: 4 });
// Pass only plain JSON into the impure boundary
const items = (response.results ?? [])
  .slice(0, 4)
  .map(it => ({ imageUrl: it.imageUrl, title: it.title }));
// 2) IMPURE: imports + fetch + disk writes happen here, returns plain JSON
const saved = await (async (items) => {
  "use impure";
  const fs = await import('node:fs/promises');
  const path = await import('node:path');
  await fs.mkdir('attached_assets/image_search', { recursive: true });
  const out = [];
  for (const [index, item] of items.entries()) {
    if (!item.imageUrl) continue;
    const download = await fetch(item.imageUrl);
    if (!download.ok) continue;
    const filePath = path.join('attached_assets/image_search', `result_${index + 1}.jpg`);
    await fs.writeFile(filePath, Buffer.from(await download.arrayBuffer()));
    out.push({ filePath, title: item.title ?? 'Image search result' });
  }
  return out;
})(items);
// 3) DURABLE: present each saved file
for (const f of saved) {
  await presentAsset({ filePath: f.filePath, title: f.title });
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Use `imageSearch`, not provider-specific passthrough callbacks, so the implementation can change underneath without changing your code.
2. For logos, search `"<company> logo png"` or `"<company> logo transparent"` and prefer official domains, press kits, or brand asset pages.
3. Present a small shortlist of the best results instead of dumping the full response body.
4. Use `extractBranding` first for official brand tokens, then fall back to `imageSearch` only when the logo is missing, low quality, or clearly wrong.
5. Keep `count` small when you are manually reviewing results. `4` to `8` is usually enough.
6. Save chosen image URLs into `attached_assets/` before presenting or reusing them elsewhere.
7. Remember that `count` is the maximum number of results, not the total number of results. When presenting to the user, there may be less results presented than how many you requested.
