description: Run runDependencyAudit, runSastScan, and runHoundDogScan and return a concise, prioritized security summary with critical/high findings first. Must use this skill if security scanning is explicitly requested by the user.

# Security Scan Skill

Run three independent scanners and summarize results:

- `runDependencyAudit()` for package/dependency vulnerabilities
- `runSastScan()` for static code findings
- `runHoundDogScan()` for privacy/security dataflow findings

## Orchestration

For full scans, run scanners in parallel and tolerate per-scanner failures.

```javascript
const [depResult, sastResult, hounddogResult] = await Promise.allSettled([
  runDependencyAudit(),
  runSastScan(),
  runHoundDogScan(),
]);

const dep = depResult.status === 'fulfilled' ? depResult.value : null;
const sast = sastResult.status === 'fulfilled' ? sastResult.value : null;
const hounddog =
  hounddogResult.status === 'fulfilled' ? hounddogResult.value : null;
```

Do not fail the whole scan because one scanner errors.

## Minimal Response Shape

- `runDependencyAudit()`
  - `metadata.vulnerabilities`: `{ info, low, moderate, high, critical }`
  - `vulnerabilities[]`: `id`, `package`, `severity`, `fix`, `source`
- `runSastScan()`
  - `results[]`: `checkId`, `message`, `severity`, `fingerprint`, `location`
- `runHoundDogScan()`
  - `vulnerabilities[]`: `hash`, `ruleIds`, `message`, `severity`, `location`, `privacyViolations`, `remediation*`

## Output Expectations

Return concise results instead of dumping full payloads:

1. Per scanner: status (`ok` or `error`) and count by severity.
2. Top critical/high findings with file path and short message.
3. A short remediation plan, with risky/breaking changes clearly called out.

## Dependency Remediation

When fixing dependency vulnerabilities, prefer upgrading the affected dependency
or its direct parent to the latest compatible version first. If the Replit
Package Firewall or security registry blocks a vulnerable package during
installation, do not bypass it and do not stop at the first block:

1. Try the latest available version of the same dependency.
2. For transitive findings, update the direct dependency that pulls it in.
3. If the latest version is still blocked or incompatible, choose a safer
   alternative package yourself and continue. Only involve the user if the
   replacement changes product behavior or there is no reasonable substitute.
