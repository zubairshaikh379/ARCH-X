# Skill Finder

Help users find the right Replit skill for their objective. When the user describes what they want to accomplish, match their goal to one or more skills from the catalog below and explain why each is a good fit.

## Process

1. **Discover available skills dynamically.** Before matching, run `skillSearch({ query: "..." })` via code execution with the user's objective as the query. This searches all currently installed skills -- including any new ones added since this file was last updated. Also scan`.local/skills/`and`.local/secondary_skills/` directories for any skills not yet in the catalog below.
2. Listen to the user's objective or question.

3. Match their goal against both the dynamic results and the catalog below.
4. Recommend 1-3 skills, ranked by relevance. For each recommendation:

- Name the skill
- Explain in plain language what it does and why it fits their goal

- Mention any prerequisites or related skills they might also need

1. If no skill matches, say so honestly and suggest alternatives (custom skill creation, web search, or manual approach).

## Keeping the Catalog Current

The catalog below is a snapshot. New skills may be added to the platform at any time. To stay current:

- Always use `skillSearch()` as the primary discovery mechanism -- it reflects the latest installed skills.
- If you discover a skill that is not in the catalog below, still recommend it and mention that it is a newer addition.

- Periodically, the user or agent can refresh the catalog by scanning `.local/skills/*/SKILL.md`and`.local/secondary_skills/*/SKILL.md` for names and descriptions, then updating this file.

## Matching Guidelines

- Match based on the user's intent, not just keywords. A user asking "how do I make my app live?" needs the **deployment** skill, even though they didn't say "deploy."
- When multiple skills could apply, recommend the most specific one first. For example, if the user wants to build a dashboard, recommend **data-visualization**over the general**react-vite** skill.

- If a task naturally involves multiple skills, list them in the order the user would use them (e.g., **database**first, then**react-vite** for a data-driven web app).
- Some skills work together frequently. Call out common pairings when relevant.
